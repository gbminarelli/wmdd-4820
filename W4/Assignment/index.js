// #1. Method Exercise
//
// Create a car object  with speed attribute then add a park method to your car
// that logs "Parking!" to the console and a stop method that returns "Stopping!"

const car = {
  speed: Math.round(Math.random() * 150), // speed is a random number in the
  // range from 0 up to (but not including) 150.

  stop() {

//
// "Screeeeetch!!" if speed is "fast" (speed attribute more than 120)
//
// "RRrch."                if speed is "medium"  (speed attribute more than 80)
//
// "sh"                       if speed is "slow"
//
// "Yikes, I don't know how fast I'm going!!!" if speed is anything else.
//
//
// Stretch:  If the speed is a number, output "Screetch!!" with that number of "e"s.

// #2: Assignment: Team Randomizer
//
// Build an object that has an array of names and a number of teams with one
// method “randomize” that will assign different names to a team. The teams will
// be called: team1, team2..etc.

// team has at least 2 members (names.length >= 2 * teams)...
const myValidator = (names, teams) => {
  if (names.length < teams) {
    return {
      name: "RangeError",

    // greater than B (10 >= 4 * 2), but not (C + 1) times greater (10 < 4 * 3).

    // than one: (A - B * C) = the number of "big teams" (with a size of C + 1).

        const randomName = cloneNames[randomIndex]; // Get a random name.
        teamMembers.push(randomName); // Add that name to the team's list.

    // clone at the end of the loop):

    //
    // Cloning "names" preserve the data for future use (we still have all the
    // names stored in the property). At the end of the sorting process the
    // clone array is, as expected, empty - all the names were sorted and
    // "spliced" out of it.
